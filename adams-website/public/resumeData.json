During my three coops I completed several major feature adds and countless tricky bug fixes. My proudest new feature was a rating system that let users give feedback on the service we provided. This came with a reporting screen that displayed all of the collected ratings, equipped with sorting and filtering functionality to boot. This feature became the third most used tool in the entire web application only a few months after it's release! During my third term, I also picked up the responsibility of managing the company newsletter. After the third newsletter I published, our audience had grown from 5726 to 8028 recipients.",

Peripheral neuropathy is a condition in which damage to the peripheral nervous system causes numbness and pain in the lower limbs and hands. Our solution to this problem was a system in which a pressure sensitive sheet was connected to a foam shoe sole, and vibrating DC motors would generate a stimulus at the thigh corresponding to pressures applied at the foot. By the end of this project, I had learnt valuable lessons about time management, technical report writing, the engineering design process, writing code with the Arduino IDE, collaboration, circuit design, and interdisciplinary work by applying an engineering solution to a physiological problem space.",
